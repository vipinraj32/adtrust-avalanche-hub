# AvaxTrust

AvaxTrust is a decentralized influencerâ€“advertiser platform built on the Avalanche blockchain.  
It enables trust, transparency, and automated payments between advertisers and influencers by using smart contracts, staking, and decentralized storage.

## Overview

The influencer marketing industry often faces challenges such as lack of trust, delayed payments, and unverifiable campaign outcomes. AvaxTrust solves these challenges by ensuring:

- Advertisers stake funds on-chain before launching campaigns.  
- Influencers can only participate in campaigns if they meet eligibility requirements.  
- Payments are automatically released upon successful campaign completion.  
- All interactions are recorded transparently on the blockchain.

## Features

### Advertiser Workflow
- Advertiser registers by staking a minimum amount of funds on Avalanche (e.g., 250 AVAX).  
- Can publish campaigns by submitting details such as:  
  - Company Name  
  - Advertiser Name  
  - Email  
  - Campaign Requirements  
  - Budget  

### Influencer Workflow
- Influencer logs in with wallet.  
- Can upload profile details, audience insights, or documents (stored on IPFS).  
- Can browse and apply for campaigns published by advertisers.  
- Smart contract + validation layer checks eligibility (based on followers, niche, or engagement).  
- Upon successful campaign completion, funds are automatically released from advertiser stake to influencer.  

### Smart Contract Logic
- **User Identity Manager**: Manages advertiser and influencer identities.  
- **Ad Registry**: Stores ad campaign details and metadata.  
- **Stake Manager**: Locks advertiser funds at registration and handles automated fund release.  
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains a transparent on-chain history of all campaigns, applications, and transactions.
